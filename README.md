# shipbreaker-custom-controls
This mod patches the game and provides a configuration tool for allowing custom controls.

This mod uses two libraries to perform its functions:

INI-Parser: https://github.com/rickyah/ini-parser
FossilDelta: https://github.com/endel/FossilDelta

To use the mod, open Shipbreaker-Custom-Controls.exe with a double click.
This will open the configuration tool. Here you can apply the custom controls patch
and change the controls of the game. More detailed instructions are on the tool itself.
Here's an example:
