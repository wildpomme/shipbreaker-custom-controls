# shipbreaker-custom-controls
This mod patches the game and provides a configuration tool for allowing custom controls.

It uses two libraries to perform its functions:

INI-Parser: https://github.com/rickyah/ini-parser
FossilDelta: https://github.com/endel/FossilDelta

Download the the zip file of the most recent version from the releases page.
You can unzip it wherever you want. Then to use the mod, open Shipbreaker-Custom-Controls.exe with a double click.
This will open the configuration tool. Here you can apply the custom controls patch
and change the controls of the game. More detailed instructions are on the tool itself.
Here's an example:

otherwise you could have some issues with this mod.
